  <h2>Channel 96</h2>
  <p>Channel 96 is a blog that covers news topics from ranging from gaming, to life's solutions to our problems. We are pro-life, and we hope to help you understand more about our ever-changing world. We create articles semi-weekly, as well as post information about them. We're hoping to continue to inform others about new advances in technology, for example.</p>

<h2>What leading with compassion looks like.</h2>
<p>Compassion, as a concept and a human quality, is an important one because it allows people to be empathetic and understanding toward other people. It means the genuine desire to remove the suffering of others. It means to recognize the pain and suffering and seek to remove those challenges as the person's best interest to. We need more compassionate people in our lives, and so I interviewed one of my online friends, who we shall call ZBang because that's what he goes by online and he doesn't want his real name to be revealed, but rather use his online name as that's the one he's more comfortable with. He told me that compassion is the most important virtue he found out of life. He told me compassion was the most important as being kind makes you a better person in general. His golden rule is to treat others the way you want to be treated. If someone was being rude to him, he would react with kindness and compassion. One of the reasons why I want to be around people like him is because compassionate people are almost always so nice to othe people, and even with someone doing something wrong, as the person being wronged, he forgives them for their actions and gives them a second chance to own up for their mistakes and not hold it against them, because that would be a grudge and no compassionate person likes holding grudges. I wish we had more people like him in the world. </p>

<h2>Students with ADHD are struggling.</h2>
<p>It's true. Those people may be lazy on the outside, and they may not turn in assignments on time either. These people are struggling in classes they don't understand anything in. There is no motivation to do them. I interviewed one of my online friends who has ADHD, and I asked them what struggles they go through. He said that he was struggling on assignments he didn't understand and he feels remorseful about it. He feels like he doesn't have the willpower to do much, except for going for those deadlines and not caring about the quality of his work because he wants everything perfect, but couldn't because he didn't know how to. It was a sad moment for us all as we realized how hopeless his, and many others' situations had become. As a result, he doesn't have any support, and he was going to not succeed because despite his hard work in the past few days trying to get everything done, everything did not make sense to him. He wonders how everyone else made it but him. He feels miserable because he's been thinking about doing those assignments for weeks, but couldn't understand what was picking on him. Let's hope he and other people like him get the support he needs.</p>
