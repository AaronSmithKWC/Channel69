<h2>What leading with compassion looks like.</h2>
<p>Compassion, as a concept and a human quality, is an important one because it allows people to be empathetic and understanding toward other people. It means the genuine desire to remove the suffering of others. It means to recognize the pain and suffering and seek to remove those challenges as the person's best interest to. We need more compassionate people in our lives, and so I interviewed one of my online friends, who we shall call ZBang because that's what he goes by online and he doesn't want his real name to be revealed, but rather use his online name as that's the one he's more comfortable with. He told me that compassion is the most important virtue he found out of life. He told me compassion was the most important as being kind makes you a better person in general. His golden rule is to treat others the way you want to be treated. If someone was being rude to him, he would react with kindness and compassion. One of the reasons why I want to be around people like him is because compassionate people are almost always so nice to othe people, and even with someone doing something wrong, as the person being wronged, he forgives them for their actions and gives them a second chance to own up for their mistakes and not hold it against them, because that would be a grudge and no compassionate person likes holding grudges. I wish we had more people like him in the world. </p>
